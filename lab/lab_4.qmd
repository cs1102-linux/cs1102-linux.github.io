All the necessary files for the lab questions can be found in the `/opt/lab_assets` directory in the course VM

## Bash Scripts

**Q1:** In Windows, whenever we delete files/folders in GUI mode, those files are moved to the Recycle Bin. Similarly, replicate that behavior in the Bash shell. Whenever we execute the `trash-cli` command, it should move deleted files to the `~/.local/Trash` folder. **(18 marks)**

(Paste the screenshot of your script content, demo usage working with one argument, multiple arguments, and wildcards)

::: {.callout-warning icon="false" appearance="minimal"}
**Hint:** `shift`, `PATH` 
:::

**Q2:** Write a Bash script that converts given phrases from a file `make_me_as_acronyms.txt` into their acronyms by following these rules:  **(16 marks)**

- Extract the first letter of each word.  
- Hyphens (-) act as word separators (like spaces).  
- Remove all other punctuation marks.  
- Convert the acronym to uppercase.  
- Print in the format **"Acronym : Given Phrase"**

## Automating Scripts

**Q3:** This question is a continuation of Q1. Automate the task of deleting files that are more than ~~30 days~~ 2 minutes old (for quick demo results) in the folder `~/.local/Trash`.  **(16 marks)**

(Paste the screenshot of your script content and `crontab`, demo usage: delete files using `trash-cli`, execute `ls ~/.local/Trash`, wait for `crontab` to run, and execute `ls ~/.local/Trash` again to show files were deleted automatically and not manually removed.)  


**Q4:**  What tasks would you like to automate on your PC? Mention at least three tasks and create pseudocode steps along with the tools you would use for task completion.  **(18 marks)**

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true"}
### Example Answer

##### **Task-1: Displaying a Philosophical Quote Every Hour**

**Pseudocode Steps:**  
1. I use `curl` to get the data from a URL like [https://zenquotes.io/api/random](https://zenquotes.io/api/random).  
2. I will pipe (`|`) the above command's output to the `jq` command and parse the JSON data.  
3. The quotation will be stored in a variable, and the variable will be passed as an argument to commands like `zenity` or `notify-send`. I will add options to automatically close the popup window after 10 seconds.  
4. The above steps will be placed in a script for `crontab` to execute every hour.  

```bash
0 * * * * /bin/bash /path/to/script
```

## SED Scripts

**Q5:** Log in to the VM and navigate to the following location: `/opt/cs1102/lab_assets/sed`. There is a file with your roll number encrypted using **Caesar Cipher**. Copy that file to your home directory. Write a `sed` script to decrypt it, ensuring your script tries all possible keys.  **(16 marks)**
(Paste the screenshot of your script content and the correct decrypted content)  

**Reference:** <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/" target="_blank">Caesar Cipher in Cryptography ðŸ§©</a>

**Q6:** Write a `sed` script that processes a given CSV file `/opt/cs1102/lab_assets/sed/students.csv`. **(16 marks)**

- Removes blank lines.  
- Converts text to uppercase.  
- Replaces commas with tabs for better readability.  
- Removes leading and trailing spaces in each field.  
- Removes all student records where CGPA is less than 8.0.  
- Masks student IDs (e.g., `101` â†’ `1XX`).  
- Adds a `Processed` tag at the end of each line.  

(Paste the screenshot of script content, demo usage: Running the script on `students.csv` and displaying modified content)
