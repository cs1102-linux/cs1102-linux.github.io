:::{.callout-note}
Do not repeat examples from the lab session in your report, as they are intended to guide your understanding
:::

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
All the necessary files for the lab questions can be found in the `/opt/lab_assets` directory in the course VM
:::


## Combining Commands and Redirections

**Q1:** Check whether the last command (it could be any command) executes successfully or not, if it executes successfully print `SUCCESS` else `FAIL`. The output should be only `SUCCESS` or `FAIL` in the terminal. **(4 marks)**

::: {.callout-warning icon="false" appearance="minimal"}
**Hint:** Use Redirections
:::

**Q2:** Write a command that accepts input in the terminal until you type `SENTENCE COMPLETED`. **(4 marks)**

**Q3:** There is log file named "`worklog.log`" where every employee has to update their daily worklog in this file. The file already contains some logs in it. Your task is write your daily worklog file named `log_<date>.txt` in the `worklog.log` file. If there are any errors during the process, they should be redirected to the `error.log` file. **(4 marks)**

**Q4:** There are multiple files in the `/opt/lab_assets` directory. Your task is collect all the **txt** files (which are in `.txt` format) and combine them into a single file named `combined_files.txt`. **(4 marks)**


**Q5:** The file named `passwords.txt` contains the list of passwords. You are required to mask all the special characters with the `*` characters and redirect the output to `masked_passwds.txt`. **(4 marks)**

::: {.callout-warning icon="false" appearance="minimal"}
**Hint:** Use `tr` command
:::

```js
# Sample Input
---
ghUh;15%
qew*3r"5
1fcDo)$.
~e45*hmn
```

```js
# Sample Output
---
ghUh*15*
qew*3r*5
1fcDo***
*e45*hmn
```


**Q6:** You are a regular user who logs into multiple websites daily(site and user_id is in the file `user_ids.txt`) but finds it difficult to remember all the passwords. Write a script that generates a random password of length 8 and stores it in a file named `gen_passwd.txt`. **(Bonus)**

```js
# Sample Input file 
#,Website,Username
-----
1,Gmail,25f1234567@es.study.iitm.ac.in
2,Facebook,25f1234567@es.study.iitm.ac.in
3,Instagram,25f1234567
4,LinkedIn,25f1234567
```

```js
# Sample Output file
#,Website,Username,Password
-----
1,Gmail,25f1234567@es.study.iitm.ac.in,ghUh;15%
2,Facebook,25f1234567@es.study.iitm.ac.in,qew*3r"5
3,Instagram,25f1234567,1fcDo)$.
4,LinkedIn,25f1234567,~e45*hmn
```

::: {.callout-tip}

::: 

## Software Management  

**Q7:** Mention at least **five** command-line utilities or software tools that you find useful. *(Conduct some research on GitHub and other sources.)*  **(15 marks)**


:::{.callout icon="false"}
Perform this task in your local machine and refer to the [instructions](/lab_instructions.qmd) 

If a tool has multiple features, demonstrate **at least three** use cases. *(This will be counted as one command-line utility.)*  
:::

###### **Example:**

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mkv output.mp3 # Convert video to audio
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -q:a 0 -map a output.mp3 # Extract audio from a video
ffmpeg -f concat -i file_list.txt -c copy output.mkv # Concatenate multiple video or audio files
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf subtitles=my_subtitles.srt output.mp4 # Burn subtitles into a video
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i watermark.png -filter_complex "overlay=10:10" output.mp4 # Add an image or text watermark to a video
ffmpeg -i SourceFileName.mkv -c:a copy -c:v copy -ss hh:mm:ss.xxx -to hh:mm:ss.xxx OutputFileName.mkv # Trim or cut parts of a video
# ...
```

<center> 
-------------------------**OR**-------------------------
</center>

:::{.callout icon="false"}
If a tool has only **one primary use**, you must demonstrate **at least three** different tools. *(This will be counted as one command-line utility.)* 
:::

###### **Example:**

```bash
dict empathy  # 'dict' is primarily used as a dictionary
factor 10  # 'factor' is mainly used to print the prime factors of a number
echo hello | rev  # 'rev' is primarily used to reverse a string
```

This question highlights that no one can know or learn everything. However, most problems already have solutions available on platforms like StackOverflow, AskUbuntu, and other forums. In the digital age, itâ€™s essential to cultivate the habit of searching for solutions and learning new concepts from such resources.
